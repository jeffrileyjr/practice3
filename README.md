•	Create a page with a background image and three buttons. One button says, ‘Toggle Image’, one says ‘Add Square’, and the other says ‘Add Circle’.
•	When toggle image is clicked the background image is removed and replaced by a slategray color. If the image is gone, clicking the button brings it back.
•	When add square or circle are clicked they add either a square or a circle with the following:
o	Squares and circles go into their own containers based on whether they are a square or circle
o	Squares are square 100px by 100px
o	Circles are round and also 100px by 100px
o	Boxes have a class square, circles have a class circle
o	Each element has a number inside starting with 1 and increasing with each click
o	When clicking a box or circle it removes that element
